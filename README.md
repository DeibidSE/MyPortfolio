# My Portfolio

This project is a private showcase of my work, skills, and achievements, built using Nuxt 3.

Although this portfolio is deeply personal in nature, I have intentionally designed it to be more or less adaptable: All displayed data is dynamically loaded from a JSON file which allows customization of the content (Obviously changing images, pdf files, routes, etc...)
