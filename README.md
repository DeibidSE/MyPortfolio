# My Portfolio

This project is a private showcase of my work, skills, and achievements, built using Nuxt 3.

Although this portfolio is deeply personal in nature, I have intentionally designed it to be more or less adaptable: All displayed data is dynamically loaded from a JSON file which allows customization of the content (Obviously changing images, pdf files, routes, etc...)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeibidSE/MyPortfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MyPortfolio/
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/MyPortfolio`

   The base url can be modified in `nuxt.config.ts`:

   ```
   export default defineNuxtConfig({
      app: {
         baseURL: '/MyPortfolio/'
      }
   })
   ```

5. **Build for Production:**

- Build and pre-render the application

  ```bash
  npx nuxi generate
  ```

- Locally preview production build:

  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

Check out the official [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.

- Deploy on GitHub Pages:

  Follow the steps detailed [HERE](https://github.com/lucpotage/nuxt-github-pages), but generate the `dist` directory using `npx nuxi generate` instead of `npm run build`

Feel free to explore my projects, skills, and more! Please look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) for more detailed information on configurations, plugins, and deployment options.
